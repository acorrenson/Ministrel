# Ministrel

**Ministrel** is a toy synchronous language for reactive programming highly inspired by
[Esterel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterel).
Its implementation closely follows the idea presented in the lecture ["Esterel de A Ã  Z"](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/gerard-berry/course-2017-2018.htm).

## What is a synchronous language ?

Some computer systems need to continuously provide outputs to react to their environment.
Such systems are called [*reactive systems*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_programming_language).

Due to their very sequential model of computation, usual programming languages such as C, Java or ML are typically not well adapted to design reactive programs. Synchronous languages, such as Esterel, offer a completely different programming paradigm especially intended to make the task of developing and reasoning about reactive systems easier. In Esterel, for example, the base building block is the notion
of signal: an Esterel program continuously reacts to input signals by emitting output signals.
Together with well chosen constructs to handle signals and combine programs, this "simple"
idea gives a very expressive language that can be use to model reactive systems in a compact
and elegant way.

## An example of reactive system

Let's take a very basic example to demonstrate the beauty of synchronous languages and their
ability to model reactive systems. The example we consider is called *ABRO* and is known to be the *hello world* of synchronous programming.

The specification of the system is as follows:

1. We consider 2 input signals `A`, `B` and one output signal `O`
2. If the user inputs an `A` and a `B`, the system outputs `O` and resets itself.
Here, `A` and `B` means either `A` followed by `B`, or `B` followed by `A`, or both `A` and `B` at the same time.
3. At any point in time, if the user inputs `R`, the system resets itself

In Esterel (and in **Ministrel**), this system can me modeled by the following very concise synchronous program:

```
loop
  abort
    { await A || await B };
    emit O;
    halt
  when R
end
```

Let's analyse the structure of this program step by step. First, the system is expected to run continuously. To do so, we use a `loop`. So far, nothing really new there.
The body of the loop is more interesting.
According to the specification, the system is supposed to reset itself each time an `R` is provided as an input signal. To handle this, we use the `abort ... when R` construct. Informally, `abort p when R` starts the execution of `p` and, if `R` is detected while `p` is executing, `p` is interrupted.

Given this new construct `abort`, we can now discuss the most important part of the program:

```
{ await A || await B };
emit O;
halt
```

There are a lot of new things here. First, the `await` instruction. `await S` block the execution until a signal `S` is detected.
The, the parallel operator `||`. `p || q` runs 2 programs `p` and `q` in parallel. In Esterel, 2 programs running in parallel have access to the exact same inputs and they receive every signal EXACTLY at the same time. In our case, `await A || await B` is going to run until both `A` and `B` are detected (either both at the same time, or one after the other). As soon as `A` and `B` have been received, a signal `O` is emitted thanks to the instruction `emit O`.
After emitting, the program can idle. We will come back to the `halt` instruction in more details later.

## A weird notion of time

Reactive systems are all about time. Over time, signals are emitted and the system react to them. To simplify things a little bit, we consider that the time is discrete and that an environment is just an infinite sequence of finite sets of signals. The output of a program is an infinite sequence of finite sets of signals.

For example, an environment for our system ABRO could be the sequence `{} {} {A B} {R} {A} {B} {R} ...` (no signal is emitted during the 2 first time units, `A` and `B` are emitted at time 3, `R` is emitted at time 4 and so on...).

The key idea in Esterel, is that basic actions take **no time** to execute. For example, the program `emit A; emit B` is going to emit `A` and `B` within the first unit of time (resulting in the sequence `{A B} ...`). This sounds counterintuitive and unrealistic, but modeling systems as if actions are executed in no time is actually what makes Esterel so elegant. However, there is one exception: the instruction `pause` is the only instruction that takes 1 unit of time to execute. The `pause` instruction can therefore be used to synchronise programs and to control which subprograms are executed at the same time or not. For example, the program `loop { emit A; pause } end` gives the output `{A} {A} ...`.
However, the program `loop { emit A } end` is forbidden because the loop body takes no time to execute. Executing such a program would lead to the production of infinitely many output signals within 0 unit of time.


## Syntax

### Base Instructions

In the following, `S` represents a signal, `T` a trap, `p` and `q` are programs.

| Base Instructions        | Description                                             |

| `nothing`                | Do nothing in 0 unit of time                            |
| `pause`                  | Do nothing in 1 unit of time                            |
| `emit S`                 | Emit a signal `S` instantly                             |
| `loop p end`             | Repeat the execution of `p`                             |
| `trap T p end`           | Trap `T` in `p`                                         |
| `exit T k`               | Trigger the `k`-th outermost trap                       |
| `if S then p else q end` | Test the signal `S` and executes `p` or `q` accordingly |
| `p ; q`                  | Execute `p` and then `q`                                |
| `p || q`                 | (Synchronous) Parallel composition of `p` and `q`       |
| `suspend p when S`       | Suspend the execution of `p` if `S` is present          |
